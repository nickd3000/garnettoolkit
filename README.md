## Garnet Toolkit

**The Non-core parts of a game engine in Java**

This is primarily a companion toolkit for the Garnet game engine,
but it can be used independently - there are no dependencies between the garnet project and the garnettoolkit project.

This project started as a way to avoid rewriting common game elements, the main components are meant to be flexible and
useful, and common to most games.

### Main Systems and components

- Scene Management
- State Machine
- Entity/Component System
- Object Context management
- Color management
- Basic collision detection
- Basic Particle
- Utilities
